Bubble sort iterates through a list by comparing 2 neighboring elements, and switch their places if left one is bigger than right one. This process is repeated until the list is fully organized. 

Bubble sort algorithm in pseudocode:

n = array length

BubbleSort(Array, n)
{
    for i = 0 to n-1
    {
        for j = 0 to n-2
        {
            if Array[j] > Array[j+1]
            {
                swap(Array[j], Array[j+1])
            }
        }
    }
}


Numbers of operations performed in each step of the algorithm:

1 assignment + n-1 (outer loop) * (n-2) (inner loop) + n * (n-1) (comparisons) + (number of swaps) operations

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
